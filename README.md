# 1.) Design & Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Practical 1 : [Insertion Sort](./DAA/practicals/R_No_16_P1_GaurangTyagi.cpp)
    - `Implement Insertion Sort  and run it on a synthetic data of (Name : string type, age : float type) for n = 10, 20, ...100. For each n, randomly generate at least 10 data sets. Report the average number of comparisons for each n. Plot a graph and obtain a best-fit curve. (6 hours)`

            a.) Write a function to sort on age

            b.) Write a function to sort on names

            c.) Sort on age and then on names so that the ordering on age is maintained. i.e. For (Reeta, 18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Geet, 18.3), the output should be  (Geet, 18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Reeta, 18.3). I.e. If there are two people with the name Reeta their records should appear so that they are sorted on their ages
* ### Practical 2 : [Real World Application](./DAA/practicals/R_No_16_P2a_GaurangTyagi.cpp)
    - `Program based on real life Application of Sorting: for example weather data or sort the edges of a graph on its weights - used in connectivity planning.`
* ### Practical 3 : [Merge Sort](./DAA/practicals/R_No_16_P2b_GaurangTyagi.cpp)
    - `Repeat practical 1 and practical 2 with Merge Sort and Compare with the results of Insertion Sort.`
* ### Practical 4 : [Quick Sort](./DAA/practicals/R_No_16_P4a_GaurangTyagi.cpp)
    - `Repeat 1 and 2 with Quick Sort and Compare with the results of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort`
* ### Practical 5 : [Randomized Quick Sort](./DAA/practicals/R_No_16_P5a_GaurangTyagi.cpp)
    - `Repeat 1 and 2 with Randomized Quick Sort and Compare with the results of QuickSort.`

# 2.)  Data Mining

* ### Practical 1 : [magic gama telescope](./DM/magic_gama_telescope/magic_gamma.ipynb)
    - `Lab 1: Exploratory Analysis and Class Imbalance Handling using the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset`
        
            Import the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Perform exploratory data analysis by visualizing the correlation between each input feature and the target class. Further, demonstrate the effect of class imbalance by applying a Random Oversampling technique and illustrate its impact on the class distribution.

* ### Practical 2 : [ChestXRay](./DM/chest_x_ray/chest_xray.ipynb)
    - `Lab 2: Data Preprocessing and Attribute-Based Segregation of Medical Imaging Data`
        
            In this exercise, you will work with the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset available at:

            https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

            The dataset includes a metadata file (metadata.csv) describing imaging attributes for each X-ray.

            You are required to perform attribute-based data selection and transformation using the metadata.

        - `Tasks`
                1. Load metadata.csv using Pandas.

                2. Select the attributes:

                    - view (categorical attribute)

                    - filename (object identifier)

                3. Perform data cleaning by:

                        - Removing records with missing or undefined view values.
                        - Ignoring records corresponding to non-PA and non-AP views.

                4. Perform data transformation and reduction by:

                    - Creating two homogeneous subsets of the dataset corresponding to PA and AP chest X-ray views.

                5. Using the cleaned metadata:

                - Create two directories (PA, AP) in Google Drive.
                - Populate them with the corresponding X-ray images from the images folder.

                6. Generate a summary report showing:

                    - Total images in the original dataset
                    - Number of images retained after preprocessing
                    - Distribution of PA and AP views

* ### Practical 1: [Basics](./SEC/practical-1/GaurangTyagi_16_P1.pdf)
    - Create a LaTeX document in Overleaf that demonstrates basic document setup
        and text formatting. Set the page size to A4, the orientation of the first page to landscape and
        the rest to portrait, the margins to 1 inch on all sides using the appropriate package. Add a
        title, your name, Roll No, affiliation, course name, date, and display them using \maketitle.
        Write a paragraph on “Importance of LaTeX in Academic Writing” and format selected words
        using bold, italic, underline, and at least three different font sizes. Demonstrate text alignment
        by creating separate text blocks showing left, right, centre, and justified alignment. Organise
        the document into at least two sections, two subsections, and two subsubsections, ensuring
        consistent formatting with proper sectioning commands rather than manual styling. Submit both
        the .tex file and the PDF file.

    - Create a LaTeX document in Overleaf that demonstrates the use of lists, tables,
        and multi-column layouts. First, create one bulleted list (e.g., a shopping list or event agenda)
        and one numbered list (e.g., steps in a process), each containing at least five items. Next, design
        a well-formatted table representing either student grades (including name, subject, marks, and
        grade) or inventory details (item name, quantity, price, and total value). The table must include
        merged cells (using \multicolumn or \multirow), clearly defined borders, and at least one

        shaded row or column for emphasis. Finally, create a short newsletter-style section in a two-
        or three-column layout (using the multicols package) that includes a title and two short articles

        (8-10 lines each). Ensure proper formatting, alignment, and clean coding practices. Submit
        both the .tex source file and the compiled PDF.
* ### Practical 3: [Equations](./SEC/practical-3/GaurangTyagi_16_P3.pdf)
    - Typeset the given equations using proper LaTeX formatting. Ensure that all
    equations are correctly aligned, symbols are appropriately formatted, and mathematical
    notation follows standard conventions. Submit both the source file (.tex) and the compiled
    output file (.pdf).
