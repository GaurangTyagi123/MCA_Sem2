# 1.) Design & Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Practical 1 : [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/GaurangTyagi123/MCA_Sem2/DAA/tree/main/DAA)
    - `Implement Insertion Sort  and run it on a synthetic data of (Name : string type, age : float type) for n = 10, 20, ...100. For each n, randomly generate at least 10 data sets. Report the average number of comparisons for each n. Plot a graph and obtain a best-fit curve. (6 hours)`

            a.) Write a function to sort on age

            b.) Write a function to sort on names

            c.) Sort on age and then on names so that the ordering on age is maintained. i.e. For (Reeta, 18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Geet, 18.3), the output should be  (Geet, 18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Reeta, 18.3). I.e. If there are two people with the name Reeta their records should appear so that they are sorted on their ages

# 2.)  Data Mining

* ### Practical 1 : [magic gama telescope](https://github.com/GaurangTyagi123/MCA_Sem2/tree/main/DM)
    - `Lab 1: Exploratory Analysis and Class Imbalance Handling using the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset`
        
            Import the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Perform exploratory data analysis by visualizing the correlation between each input feature and the target class. Further, demonstrate the effect of class imbalance by applying a Random Oversampling technique and illustrate its impact on the class distribution.
